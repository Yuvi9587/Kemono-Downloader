## ‚ú® What's New in v5.3.0
-   **Multi-Creator Post Fetching & Queuing:**
    -   The **Creator Selection popup** (üé® icon) has been significantly enhanced.
    -   After selecting multiple creators, you can now click a new "**Fetch Posts**" button.
    -   This will retrieve and display posts from all selected creators in a new view within the popup.
    -   You can then browse these fetched posts (with search functionality) and select individual posts.
    -   A new "**Add Selected Posts to Queue**" button allows you to add your chosen posts directly to the main download queue, streamlining the process of gathering content from multiple artists.
    -   The traditional "**Add Selected to URL**" button is still available if you prefer to populate the main URL field with creator names.
-   **Improved Favorite Download Queue Handling:**
    -   When items are added to the download queue from the Creator Selection popup, the main URL input field will now display a placeholder message (e.g., "{count} items in queue from popup").
    -   The queue is now more robustly managed, especially when interacting with the main URL input field after items have been queued from the popup.

## ‚ú® What's New in v5.1.0
-   **Enhanced Error File Management**: The "Error" button now opens a dialog listing files that failed to download. This dialog includes:
    -   An option to **retry selected** failed downloads.
    -   A new **"Export URLs to .txt"** button, allowing users to save links of failed downloads either as "URL only" or "URL with details" (including post title, ID, and original filename).
    -   Fixed a bug where files skipped during retry (due to existing hash match) were not correctly removed from the error list.
-   **Improved UI Stability**: Addressed issues with UI state management to more accurately reflect ongoing download activities (including retries and external link downloads). This prevents the "Cancel" button from becoming inactive prematurely while operations are still running.

## ‚ú® What's New in v5.2.0
-   **Multi-language Support:** The interface now supports multiple languages: English, Japanese, French, Spanish, German, Russian, Korean, and Chinese (Simplified). Select your preferred language in the new Settings dialog.
-   **Theme Selection:** Choose between Light and Dark application themes via the Settings dialog for a personalized viewing experience.
-   **Centralized Settings:** A new Settings dialog (accessible via a settings button, often with a gear icon) provides a dedicated space for language and appearance customizations.
-   **Internal Localization:** Introduced `languages.py` for managing UI translations, streamlining the addition of new languages by contributors.

## Troubleshooting

### AttributeError: module 'asyncio' has no attribute 'coroutine'

If you encounter an error message similar to:
```
AttributeError: module 'asyncio' has no attribute 'coroutine'. Did you mean: 'coroutines'?
```
This usually means that a dependency, often `tenacity` (used by `mega.py`), is an older version that's incompatible with your Python version (typically Python 3.10+).

To fix this, activate your virtual environment and run the following commands to upgrade the libraries:

```bash
pip install --upgrade tenacity
pip install --upgrade mega.py
```
