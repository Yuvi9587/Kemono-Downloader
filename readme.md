##  What's New in v4.0.0?

Version 3.5.0 focuses on enhancing access to content and providing even smarter organization:

###  Cookie Management

- **Access Content:** Seamlessly download from Kemono/Coomer as if you were logged in by using your browser's cookies.
- **Flexible Input:**
  - Directly paste your cookie string (e.g., `name1=value1; name2=value2`).
  - Browse and load cookies from a `cookies.txt` file (Netscape format).
  - Automatic fallback to a `cookies.txt` file in the application directory if "Use Cookie" is enabled and no other source is specified.
- **Easy Activation:** A simple "Use Cookie" checkbox in the UI controls this feature.
- *Important Note: Cookie settings (text, file path, and enabled state) are configured per session and are not saved when the application is closed. You will need to re-apply them on each launch if needed.*

###  Advanced `Known.txt` and Character Filtering

The `Known.txt` system has been revamped for improved performance and stability. The previous method of handling known names could become resource-intensive with large lists, potentially leading to application slowdowns or crashes. This new, streamlined system offers more direct control and robust organization.
The `Known.txt` file and the "Filter by Character(s)" input field work together to provide powerful and flexible content organization. The `Known.txt` file itself has a straightforward syntax, while the UI input allows for more complex session-specific grouping and alias definitions that can then be added to `Known.txt`.

**1. `Known.txt` File Syntax (Located in App Directory):**

`Known.txt` stores your persistent list of characters, series, or keywords for folder organization. Each line is an entry:

- **Simple Entries:**
  - A line like `My Awesome Series` or `Nami`.
  - **Behavior:** Content matching this term will be saved into a folder named "My Awesome Series" or "Nami" respectively (if "Separate Folders" is enabled).

**2. "Filter by Character(s)" UI Input Field:**

This field allows for dynamic filtering for the current download session and provides options for how new entries are added to `Known.txt`.

- **Standard Names:**
  - Input: `Nami, Robin`
  - Session Behavior: Filters for "Nami" OR "Robin". If "Separate Folders" is on, creates folders "Nami" and "Robin".
  - `Known.txt` Addition: If "Nami" is new and selected for addition in the confirmation dialog, it's added as `Nami` on a new line in `Known.txt`.

- **Grouped Aliases for a Single Character (using `(...)~` syntax):**
  - Input: `(Boa, Hancock)~`
  - Meaning: "Boa" and "Hancock" are different names/aliases for the *same character*. The names are listed within parentheses separated by commas (e.g., `name1, alias1, alias2`), and the entire group is followed by a `~` symbol. This is useful when a creator uses different names for the same character.
  - Session Behavior: Filters for "Boa" OR "Hancock". If "Separate Folders" is on, creates a single folder named "Boa Hancock".
  - `Known.txt` Addition: If this group is new and selected for addition, it's added to `Known.txt` as a grouped alias entry, typically `(Boa Hancock, Boa, Hancock)`. The first name in the `Known.txt` entry (e.g., "Boa Hancock") becomes the primary folder name.

- **Combined Folder for Distinct Characters (using `(...)` syntax):**
  - Input: `(Vivi, Uta)`
  - Meaning: "Vivi" and "Uta" are *distinct characters*, but for this download session, their content should be grouped into a single folder. The names are listed within parentheses separated by commas. This is useful for grouping art of less frequent characters without creating many small individual folders.
  - Session Behavior: Filters for "Vivi" OR "Uta". If "Separate Folders" is on, creates a single folder named "Vivi Uta".
  - `Known.txt` Addition: If this "combined group" is new and selected for addition, "Vivi" and "Uta" are added to `Known.txt` as *separate, individual simple entries* on new lines:
    ```
    Vivi
    Uta
    ```
    The combined folder "Vivi Uta" is a session-only convenience; `Known.txt` stores them as distinct entities for future individual use.

**3. Interaction with `Known.txt`:**

- **Adding New Names from Filters:** When you use the "Filter by Character(s)" input, if any names or groups are new (not already in `Known.txt`), a dialog will appear after you start the download. This dialog allows you to select which of these new names/groups should be added to `Known.txt`, formatted according to the rules described above.
- **Intelligent Fallback:** If "Separate Folders by Name/Title" is active, and content doesn't match the "Filter by Character(s)" UI input, the downloader consults your `Known.txt` file for folder naming.
- **Direct Management:** You can add simple entries directly to `Known.txt` using the list and "Add" button in the UI's `Known.txt` management section. For creating or modifying complex grouped alias entries directly in the file, or for bulk edits, click the "Open Known.txt" button. The application reloads `Known.txt` on startup or before a download process begins.

##  What's in v3.5.0? (Previous Update)
This version brings significant enhancements to manga/comic downloading, filtering capabilities, and user experience:

###  Enhanced Manga/Comic Mode

- **New "Date Based" Filename Style:**

  - Perfect for truly sequential content! Files are named numerically (e.g., `001.jpg`, `002.jpg`, `003.ext`...) across an *entire creator's feed*, strictly following post publication order.

  - **Smart Numbering:** Automatically resumes from the highest existing number found in the series folder (and subfolders, if "Subfolder per Post" is enabled).

  - **Guaranteed Order:** Disables multi-threading for post processing to ensure sequential accuracy.

  - Works alongside the existing "Post Title" and "Original File Name" styles.

---

###  "Remove Words from Filename" Feature

- Specify comma-separated words or phrases (case-insensitive) that will be automatically removed from filenames.

- Example: `patreon, [HD], _final` transforms `AwesomeArt_patreon` `Hinata_Hd` into `AwesomeArt.jpg` `Hinata.jpg`.

---

###  New "Only Archives" File Filter Mode

- Exclusively downloads `.zip` and `.rar` files.

- Automatically disables conflicting options like "Skip .zip/.rar" and external link logging.

---

###  Improved Character Filter Scope - "Comments (Beta)"

- **File-First Check:** Prioritizes matching filenames before checking post comments for character names.

- **Comment Fallback:** Only checks comments if no filename match is found, reducing unnecessary API calls.

---

###  Refined "Missed Character Log"

- Displays a capitalized, alphabetized list of key terms from skipped post titles.

- Makes it easier to spot patterns or characters that might be unintentionally excluded.

---

###  Enhanced Multi-part Download Progress

- Granular visibility into active chunk downloads and combined speed for large files.

---

###  Updated Onboarding Tour

- Improved guide for new users, covering v4.0.0 features and existing core functions.

---

###  Robust Configuration Path

    - `(Vivi, Uta)` (distinct characters, session folder "Vivi Uta", adds `Vivi` and `Uta` separately to `Known.txt`)
  - See "Advanced `Known.txt` and Character Filtering" for full details.
