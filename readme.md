## ✨ What's New in v3.4.0?

This version brings significant enhancements to manga/comic downloading, filtering capabilities, and user experience:

---

### 📖 Enhanced Manga/Comic Mode

- **New "Date Based" Filename Style:**

  - Perfect for truly sequential content! Files are named numerically (e.g., `001.jpg`, `002.jpg`, `003.ext`...) across an *entire creator's feed*, strictly following post publication order.

  - **Smart Numbering:** Automatically resumes from the highest existing number found in the series folder (and subfolders, if "Subfolder per Post" is enabled).

  - **Guaranteed Order:** Disables multi-threading for post processing to ensure sequential accuracy.

  - Works alongside the existing "Post Title" and "Original File Name" styles.

---

### ✂️ "Remove Words from Filename" Feature

- Specify comma-separated words or phrases (case-insensitive) that will be automatically removed from filenames.

- Example: `patreon, [HD], _final` transforms `AwesomeArt_patreon` `Hinata_Hd` into `AwesomeArt.jpg` `Hinata.jpg`.

---

### 📦 New "Only Archives" File Filter Mode

- Exclusively downloads `.zip` and `.rar` files.

- Automatically disables conflicting options like "Skip .zip/.rar" and external link logging.

---

### 🗣️ Improved Character Filter Scope - "Comments (Beta)"

- **File-First Check:** Prioritizes matching filenames before checking post comments for character names.

- **Comment Fallback:** Only checks comments if no filename match is found, reducing unnecessary API calls.

---

### 🧐 Refined "Missed Character Log"

- Displays a capitalized, alphabetized list of key terms from skipped post titles.

- Makes it easier to spot patterns or characters that might be unintentionally excluded.

---

### 🚀 Enhanced Multi-part Download Progress

- Granular visibility into active chunk downloads and combined speed for large files.

---

### 🗺️ Updated Onboarding Tour

- Improved guide for new users, covering v3.4.0 features and existing core functions.

---

### 🛡️ Robust Configuration Path

- Settings and `Known.txt` are now stored in the system-standard application data folder (e.g., `AppData`, `~/.local/share`).
